# aframe-ring-controls
A-frame.js component to move the camera just looking a ring surrounding you! Most VR headsets have features enabled, such as teleportation or a directional pad, to navigate through the scene. However, cardboard-type devices (with a mobile phone) usually don't have any buttons to activate teleport controls. With the use of this ring, even the most humble (and advanced) devices will be able to move through the scene by simply looking at the controls located at their feet.
