# aframe-ring-controls
A-frame.js component that allows you to move the camera position by simply looking at a ring surrounding you! 

Most VR headsets have built-in features like real-time positioning, raycaster teleportation or a directional pad for navigating through the scene. However, devices like Cardboard (used with mobile phones) usually lack buttons to activate teleportation controls. With the use of this ring, even the most basic or advanced devices will be able to move through the scene by simply looking at the controls located at their feet. It is my first component and it is redundant, but it works!
